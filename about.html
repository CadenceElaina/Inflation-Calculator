            <p>This US Inflation Calculator measures the purchasing power of dollar from 1913 to 2022.
                Enter a start year with an amount in dollars then enter an end year and click "Calculate" below to see
                how that value changes. The cumulative rate of inflation between the two years will also be displayed.

                <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by
                    urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Indexes are available for the
                    U.S. and various geographic areas. Average price data for select utility, automotive fuel, and food
                    items are also available.</p>
                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>With inflation rising I found myself utilizing inflation calculators to compare salaries to just a
                    few years ago, to give myself a better perspective of what I should seek from employers. I thought
                    the idea of an inflation calculator as a cool project and so I put this webpage together. I found
                    this to be a great way to practice manipulating user input with JavaScript, while making continuing
                    my HTML/CSS skills. The functions are simple, but I also worked with modules and feel more
                    comfortable setting user input into variables to be used by functions. I am excited to continue to
                    refine this page and my programming skills :D! </p>
