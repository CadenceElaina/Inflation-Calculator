 TODO:
 1. formatting... Body sections and nav-section should be spaced better? 
 2. Hover over links animation is nice, but can overlap text on some pages
 3. links in footer lack cohesiveness with page
 4. overall symetry of the page is sus
 5. positioning of table and the data headers are too close and not easy to read??
