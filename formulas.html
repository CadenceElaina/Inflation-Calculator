            <p>This US Inflation Calculator measures the purchasing power of dollar from 1913 to 2022.
                Enter a start year with an amount in dollars then enter an end year and click "Calculate" below to see
                how that value changes. The cumulative rate of inflation between the two years will also be displayed.

                <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by
                    urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Indexes are available for the
                    U.S. and various geographic areas. Average price data for select utility, automotive fuel, and food
                    items are also available.</p>

                    <li>Inflation: Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time. A
                        quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be
                        reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services
                        in an economy over some period of time. The rise in prices, which is often expressed as a
                        percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.
